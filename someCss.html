        <h1> A Student Analysis: The University Of Washington </h1>
        <h1>About UW</h1>

        <p style= "font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;">
            The University of Washington is one of the oldest educational institutions in the state of Washington, founded in 1861. Millions of UW's alumni are spread throughout the globe
         and thousands of students pass through the school every single year. This number continues to grow higher every year as more students apply to UW. UW has a beautiful campus that 
        includes a large fountain, a Harry Potter style library and beautiful cherry blossoms in the Spring time. </p>

        <h1>A Student Perspective</h1>

    
        <p style= "font-family: cursive; text-decoration: overline;">     
            I am a student at the University of Washington and while I love it for its athletics, diverse student body and great professors it also has its downsides.
            This includes a restrictive and competitive major system that prevents many students from studying their desired major. Along with this, the large numbers of students 
            within a classroom does not allow for much one on one interactions with professors. However, despite these shortcomings UW provides the best and most well-rounded education
            in Washington and its prestige remains higher than ever in the state. </p>
